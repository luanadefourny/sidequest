## One liner

Write a very short sentence (< 10 words) that describes what your app is about (e.g. “Airbnb for boats”, or “Movies recommendation engine”).

**Answer: Micro adventure / things to do recommendations (location based)**

## Project description

Provide a short description of what the app does (< 1000 characters).

**Answer: Basic recommendations for things to do - nearby, simple and not too time-consuming when you're bored or want something new/different to do. Has a filtering system to narrow down the suggestions, or a random feature if feeling adventurous. The focus is on solo suggestions for now, allowing to expand to small/big group suggestions later on. Mobile first!**

## MVP

Choose the core feature that most defines your app and you’ll start to tackle first (e.g. “Users should be able to take a picture of a food item with their smartphone and receive a list of recipes based on that ingredient”).

**Answer: User inputs location and selects filters (or random) and gets a suggestion back on something to go do.**

## Additional features

Add a list of other features you’d like to add once the MVP is working.

**Answer: saving favorites, authentication, geolocalization, desktop version,  group filter for suggestions; time-permitting: share with a friend, meetup with other user (location in the middle)**

## Tech stack

Does your app have a client, a server, or both? If it has a client, is it web or mobile? What frameworks, databases, or relevant libraries are you going to use? Fill the fields here below as needed.

**Front End: React, Vite, TypeScript (subject to change), Tailwind, Axios**

**Back End: Node.js, Express, MongoDB (mongoose), JWT tokens or Lucia Auth**

>**Will research authentication to make sure it works with rest of tech stack**

## Data sources

In case your app relies on some data to work properly, where are you planning to get that data from?

**Answer: Mock data to begin with! Need to look into APIs but:**

**- Things to do: Google Places API + EventBrite API**

**- User location: Geolocation API**

**- Map: Leaflet.js**
